# Sales Performance & Commission Analysis Dashboard


## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution built in Excel to monitor sales efficiency, 
regional performance, and commission payouts. It transforms a complex dataset into an 
interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to filter performance by region and product 
category.


## Key Features

- Interactive Slicers: Dynamic filtering for regions (East, North, South, West) that updates
  all charts instantly.
- Automated Commission Logic: Integrated formulas that calculate Total Pay and Net Profit
  based on sales volume and baseline salaries.
- Multi-Layered Visualizations: Includes profit rankings, volume trends, and revenue mix
  analysis.

### 1. Sales Leaderboard (Net Profit by Person)

This dashboard identifies high-value assets by ranking the sales team based on their direct 
contribution to net margin rather than just gross volume.

- Key Feature: Integrated "Area" Slicers allow for instantaneous regional comparative 
  analysis.
- Business Insight: Isolates net profit after accounting for $625 base salaries and 50%
  commission structures to show true "bottom-line" value.

### 2. Revenue Mix (Product vs. Total Revenue)

A "deep dive" visualization that provides a granular breakdown of product-level contribution.

- Key Feature: Utilizes dual-axis charts to overlay specific category revenue (e.g., Tables,
  Chairs) against total sales trends.
- Business Insight: Identifies "anchor products" that drive the majority of a salesperson's
  success, aiding in inventory strategy.

West regions.

- Business Insight: Highlights the West region as the top performer for Tables (82 units)
- and Cabinets (80 units).
